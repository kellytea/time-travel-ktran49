I learned how to mainly control creating and working between multiple branches at once which is a lot more difficult than having a smoother interface either on GitHub or and IDE. There were some features I didn't know about such as git tags to label release versions which reflect a lot on the newer things that I have learned from this lab.

Some mistakes I made during the process was not properly writing good commit messages, I'd forget to label them such as feat or fix to easily see what type of changes I was making in that commit. To resolve this, I learned how to rebase and rename for the next commit to clarify what that previous commit was about.

Another mistake that I made was that I'd forget to include some files in my changes to stage for the next commit, such as .gitignore. To mediate this, I just did git add -A to ensure that I stage all of my changed files.
